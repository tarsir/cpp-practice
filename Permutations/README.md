# C++ Practice Repository

This repo is just for storing all my C++ practice code, because my C++ skills are super rusty these days.

There is no Makefile or anything for them right now because they're all kind of one-offy solutions.

## What I've Done

* Permutations of a list of characters via recursion

### Why are there Visual Studio files in the repo?

Because I did the first one in Visual Studio and I'm lazy. You can safely ignore them probably.
